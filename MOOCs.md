# Massive Open Online Courses and Other Online Courses
Here is a list of free courses from top universities in the world.
Most of them are hosted on Coursera platforme or (class-central.com)[class-central.com].
Many of these courses are completely self-paced, so you can start taking them at your convenience.

Note: This list is entirely inspired from https://www.class-central.com/report/coursera-free-online-courses/ and qz.com/1120344/200-universities-just-launched-600-free-online-courses-heres-the-full-list/
